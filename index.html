	<ul><b>Volunteering at the Association for Holocaust Survivors</b></ul>
	<br/>The Corona period posed a challenge for all of us and especially for the third group age people.
    <br/>They were required to handle loneliness, complex technological challenges
    <br/>and they had to adapt to the changes in this period.
    <br/>Me and my daghter,the younger generation, wanted to help and be on the giving side.
	<br/>We want teach our children what free love and giving without acceptance is.
    <br/>Then we found the Holocaust Welfare Fund.
	<br/>My daughter and I volunteer at the Holocaust Survivors Association. 
	<br/>We attend a weekly meeting at the Survivor's House teaching them to use an accessible tablet for seniors.
	<br/>we teach them how to connect via tablet to WhatsApp, video calls, phone calls, camera use and video.
